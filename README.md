# Nanoflann

Very basic C function wrappers around the
[nanoflann](https://github.com/jlblancoc/nanoflann) k nearest neighbors library,
and associated julia interface on top of that.  This was created mainly for a
benchmark comparison with NearestNeighbors.jl; it probably won't go any further.

After installing, run test/benchmark.jl
