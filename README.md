# Nanoflann

Very basic wrapper around the
[nanoflann](https://github.com/jlblancoc/nanoflann) k nearest neighbors library.

This was created mainly for benchmarking NearestNeighbors.jl, and may not go any
further...

Instructions: Compile src/nanoflann.cpp using a C++ compiler, and run test/benchmark.jl.
